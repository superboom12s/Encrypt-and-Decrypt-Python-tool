# Encrypt-and-Decrypt-Python-Tool V1
This python library lets you encrypt and decrypt any kind of text.

You can use crypSec() to encrypt and decrypt text by a unique alphabet code.
You can encrypt both english and spanish text.

Example:
Encrypt 'Hexade' -> oN5FDN
Encrypt 'superboom12s' -> EJGNM2HH0nbE
Encrypt 'GitHub' -> pILoJ2
Encrypt 'Python' -> qKLAH1

As you can see, the encrypted text is not beautiful, but its not meant to be so.
