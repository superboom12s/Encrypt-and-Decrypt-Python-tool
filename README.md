# Encrypt-and-Decrypt-Python-Tool V1
This python library lets you encrypt and decrypt any kind of text.

You can use crypSec() to encrypt text by a unique alphabet code.
You can encrypt both english and spanish text.

Use DecrypSec() to decrypt text that has been encrypted with this tool.

Example:
Encrypt 'Hexade' -> aóCLJó
Encrypt 'superboom12s' -> KPMóS9NNúmnK
Encrypt 'GitHub' -> sORaP9
Encrypt 'Python' -> rQRGN8

As you can see, the encrypted text is not beautiful, but its not meant to be so.
